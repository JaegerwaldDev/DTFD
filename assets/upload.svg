<svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
    do not change viewbox, unless you update the svg to match    
    viewbox sets the coordinate scale inside the svg             
    which will automatically be scaled to whatever you set in CSS help this is overwhelming and i dont like it
    basically, it's just describing the picture, similar to HTML 
    <defs>
        this defines a mask, which cuts the plus shape from the circle
        this is then used later when the circle is actually defined   
        <mask id="plus">
            first, fill the masking canvas with white                    
            this will allow the element being masked to show through     
            think of it like the opposite of Figura's emissives          
            fully white will do nothing at all to the base texture       
            while full black will make the base texture fully transparent
            <rect width="24" height="24" fill="white" />
            now I put both lines in a group so both of their properties can be changed at once
            black will create transparency when the mask is applied                           
            <g stroke="black" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-width="2">
                <line x1="12" y1="4" x2="12" y2="20" />
                <line x1="4" y1="12" x2="20" y2="12" />
            </g>
        </mask>
    </defs>
    apparently live share doesn't support viewing uploaded pngs uh oh
    now I apply the mask, which will cut a plus into the circle      
    and fill the circle with the color provided by CSS               
    <circle cx="12" cy="12" r="12" fill="currentcolor" mask="url(#plus)" />
    oh by the way plain text like this is perfectly valid svg and will be ignored

    oh, then why are you commenting lol?
    because I forgot
    mood
